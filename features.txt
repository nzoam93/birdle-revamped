Things I am trying to accomplish:

General Wordle
- create the board
- create the keyboard
- color-code the squares appropriately
- if there's more than one of the same letter, handle that appropriately
- color-code the keyboard appropriately
- organize files in a structured manner
- import a file of all the allowed words
- effect if the user inputs a word that isn't actually in the dictionary
- have it match stylistically to the wordle styling (including dark mode)
- allow the user to use the virtual keyboard to play too
- allow it to be dynamically structured so it can be words of varying lengths
- update to once-a-day or general play functionality
- sending out messages like Wordle allows 


Birdle:
- input in the functionality from birdle
    - image
    - only birds as the possibility
    - unblurring as we go

One-Off-Wordle:
